# it is used to build web applications that can be accessed from any device.
# it is used to build web applications that can be integrated with other applications.
# it is used to build web applications that can be easily tested.
# it is used to build web applications that can be easily deployed.
# these are the reasons why rest api is used.

protocal ,hostname,router,method,headers,body,response,status code
# protocal - http, https
# hostname - www.example.com
# router - /api/v1/users
